# A (esbuild / yarn / React) app test
I'm sure there's plenty wrong with it ;)

```
# Toolchain setup (skip if you already have it)
$ brew install esbuild yarn

# Project install
$ yarn install

# Project build
$ yarn run build

# Serve
$ php -S localhost:8080 -t build/
```

Builds in 0.22s for me.
